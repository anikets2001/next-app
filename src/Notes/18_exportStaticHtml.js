“Export Static HTML” refers to generating a fully static website — 
meaning all pages are pre-rendered as plain .html files at build time, without any server-side logic involved.


When should you use it
Use next export when your app:

✅ Only uses Static Site Generation (SSG)
✅ Doesn’t need dynamic SSR or API routes
✅ Doesn't use middleware or getServerSideProps
✅ Works without a custom server
